## PRIORITY 1: Fix Android Build

### Current Issue
`react-native-screens` Kotlin compilation errors on React Native 0.73.2

### Solution Options

#### Option A: Upgrade to React Native 0.74+ ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Pros:**
- Modern version with better Kotlin support
- All packages compatible
- Future-proof
- Clean solution

**Cons:**
- 2-3 hours implementation
- Need to test all features

**Steps:**
1. Upgrade React Native: 0.73.2 → 0.74.5
2. Update all dependencies to compatible versions
3. Update Gradle configuration
4. Test build
5. Fix any migration issues

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

#### Option B: Use Expo Managed Workflow
**Pros:**
- No native build issues
- EAS Cloud builds
- Simpler maintenance
- OTA updates

**Cons:**
- Migration effort
- Different project structure
- Some limitations

**Steps:**
1. Install Expo SDK
2. Migrate to Expo project structure
3. Configure app.json/app.config.js
4. Setup EAS Build
5. Test on devices

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

---

#### Option C: Continue Debugging (NOT Recommended)
