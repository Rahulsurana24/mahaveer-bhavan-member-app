# Admin Portal - Security Testing & Deployment Report

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Security Headers (netlify.toml)
✅ **X-Frame-Options**: DENY - Prevents clickjacking attacks

✅ **Referrer-Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
✅ **Content-Security-Policy**: Comprehensive CSP with:
   - Restricted script sources
   - Restricted style sources
   - Supabase connection whitelist
   - Frame ancestors blocked
✅ **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled (1 year)
✅ **Cache Headers**: Optimized caching for static assets

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization (`src/utils/security.ts`)
✅ **sanitizeString**: Removes XSS-prone characters (<, >, javascript:, event handlers)
✅ **isValidEmail**: Email format validation with regex
✅ **isValidPhone**: 10-digit phone number validation

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
✅ **ProtectedRoute Component**: Multi-level access control
   - Authentication check
   - Admin role verification
   - Super admin role verification
   - Password change enforcement
   - Automatic redirect to login for unauthorized access

✅ **Role Hierarchy**:
   - Super Admin: Full system access (superadmin, super_admin)

   - Management Admin: Event & finance management (management_admin)
   - Partial Admin: Custom permissions (partial_admin)
   - View Only: Read-only access (view_only_admin)
   - Trustee: Trustee access (trustee)

### 4. Database Security
✅ **Supabase RLS**: Row Level Security policies enforce data access
✅ **Parameterized Queries**: All Supabase queries use parameterization
✅ **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized before database operations

## 📋 Page-by-Page Testing Results

## 🔐 Security Vulnerabilities Checked

### ✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Status**: Protected
- **Measures**:
  - Input sanitization utility functions
  - React's built-in XSS protection (escaped rendering)
  - CSP headers prevent inline script execution

### ✅ SQL Injection
- **Status**: Protected
- **Measures**:
  - Supabase uses parameterized queries
  - No raw SQL strings from user input
  - SQL injection detection utility added

### ✅ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Status**: Protected
- **Measures**:
  - Supabase JWT tokens
  - Same-origin policy enforced by CSP
  - No cookies used for auth (JWT in memory)

### ✅ Clickjacking
- **Status**: Protected
- **Measures**: X-Frame-Options: DENY header

### ✅ Authentication Bypass
- **Status**: Protected
- **Measures**:
  - ProtectedRoute component on all routes
  - Role-based access control
  - Supabase Auth handles session management

### ✅ Sensitive Data Exposure
- **Status**: Protected
- **Measures**:
  - No API keys in frontend code (use environment variables)
  - Passwords never logged or displayed
  - HTTPS enforced via HSTS

### ⚠️ Rate Limiting
- **Status**: Partially Protected
- **Measures**:
  - Client-side rate limit helper added
  - **Recommendation**: Implement server-side rate limiting in Supabase Edge Functions
