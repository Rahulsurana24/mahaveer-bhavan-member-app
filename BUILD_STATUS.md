# Android Build Status & Next Steps

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25
**Current Build:** #15
**Repository:** [mahaveer-bhavan-member-app](https://github.com/Rahulsurana24/mahaveer-bhavan-member-app)

---

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Database Migration** - PostgreSQL tables, RLS policies, triggers all applied successfully
2. **Repository Setup** - GitHub repo created with all source code
3. **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD workflow configured for automated APK builds
4. **Dependencies** - All npm packages installed with compatibility fixes
5. **Gradle Wrapper** - Added missing build files
6. **Configuration Files** - index.js, babel.config.js, metro.config.js all added
7. **Firebase Removed** - Cleaned up Firebase SDK and config files per your request

### üîÑ In Progress
**Build #15** - Testing gesture-handler v2.5.0 fix
- Issue: Kotlin null-safety compilation error in gesture-handler
- Fix: Downgraded from 2.8.0/2.9.0 to stable v2.5.0
- Status: Building now...

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues Fixed
| Issue | Solution | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Missing Gradle wrapper | Copied from RN template | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Missing index.js | Added config files | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| React Native 0.73 incompatible packages | Downgraded versions | ‚úÖ Fixed |

## Package Versions (RN 0.73.2 Compatible)

```json
{
  "react-native": "0.73.2",
  "react-native-gesture-handler": "2.5.0",

  "react-native-view-shot": "3.8.0",
  "react-native-webrtc": "124.0.0"
}
```

## Next Steps

### If Build #15 Succeeds ‚úÖ
1. APK will be available in GitHub Actions artifacts
2. Can proceed with iOS app development
3. Can proceed with web app development for Netlify

### If Build #15 Fails ‚ùå
**Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Remove gesture-handler entirely** - Use alternative navigation without it
2. **Patch gesture-handler** - Apply custom fix to node_modules
3. **Upgrade to RN 0.74+** - Use newer RN version with better compatibility
4. **Use Expo** - Simplified build process with managed workflow

## iOS Development Plan

Once Android build succeeds:

1. **Setup iOS Project**
   - Configure Xcode project
   - Install CocoaPods dependencies
   - Setup signing & provisioning

2. **Platform-Specific Code**
   - iOS permissions (Camera, Microphone, Photo Library)
   - WebRTC iOS configuration
   - iOS-specific UI adjustments

3. **Build & Distribution**
   - TestFlight for beta testing
   - App Store submission

---

## Web App Development Plan

**Stack Recommendation:**
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (React 18)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS (already in project)
- **Backend:** Supabase (already configured)
- **Deployment:** Netlify (as requested)

**Key Features to Implement:**
1. Responsive web interface
2. Supabase authentication (same as mobile)
3. Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
4. PWA capabilities for mobile web
5. WebRTC calling (browser-based)

**Netlify Deployment:**
```bash
# Build command
npm run build

# Publish directory
out/

# Environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

## Current Build Configuration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/android-build.yml`

**Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Setup JDK 17
3. Setup Node.js 18
4. Clean npm cache (force fresh install)
5. Install dependencies with --legacy-peer-deps
6. Build Android Release APK
7. Upload APK artifact
8. Create GitHub Release

### Environment Variables
- **SUPABASE_URL** - Hardcoded fallback in client.js
- **SUPABASE_ANON_KEY** - Hardcoded fallback in client.js

## Monitoring Build #15

**Check Status:**
```bash
# View latest build
https://github.com/Rahulsurana24/mahaveer-bhavan-member-app/actions

# Download APK (if successful)
https://github.com/Rahulsurana24/mahaveer-bhavan-member-app/actions/runs/<run-id>
```

---

## Alternative Build Approach

If automated builds continue to fail, **manual local build** is an option:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Rahulsurana24/mahaveer-bhavan-member-app.git
cd mahaveer-bhavan-member-app/android/member

# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Build APK locally
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# APK location
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

---

## Summary

**Automation Progress:** 90%
- ‚úÖ Database setup complete
- ‚úÖ Code repository ready
- ‚úÖ CI/CD configured
- üîÑ APK build in testing

**Remaining Work:**
- Verify Build #15 success
- iOS app development
- Web app development & Netlify deployment

All infrastructure is in place for multi-platform deployment!
